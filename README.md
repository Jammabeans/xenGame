# XenGame

XenGame is an open-source decentralized game built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows players to participate in key-based rounds and win Ether. The project encourages other developers to utilize the provided NFT registry and Xen Burn contracts for their own open-source projects related to Xen.

This project has been developed under the guidelines set forth by the Fair Crypto Foundation, adhering to its first principles of self-custody, transparency, consensus-based trust, and permissionless value exchange. Accordingly, this project values the ethos of decentralization and exercises these principles by not incorporating any administrative access keys or functions.

Given these considerations, it is important to note that all users are encouraged to conduct their own research and due diligence prior to using this contract. Potential users should understand, evaluate, and accept the inherent risks associated with its use, owing to the blockchain and smart contract technology underpinning it.

Please be advised, due to the intentional absence of administrative access keys in this smart contract, and the elimination of central authority, the original developers or contributors maintain no control over the system once it is deployed, placing them on an equivalent footing with any other user.

The developers, hence, assume no liability or responsibility whatsoever for any future errors, exploits, or security breaches that may occur, unforeseen or otherwise. This software is distributed "AS-IS" without warranties or conditions of any kind, either expressed or implied.

As an open-source project, all users participate at their own risk and assume full responsibility for all actions undertaken in connection with this contract, including but not limited to any loss or damage incurred. Each user, by engaging with the contract and its functionalities, comprehensively and irrevocably accepts this accountability.

Moreover, potential and existing users should be fully aware of and stay compliant with the laws and regulations in their respective jurisdictions. It is the sole responsibility of each user to understand and adhere to the relevant laws and regulations applicable in their location.

Please be advised that interactions with cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies come with significant risk. Users should always exercise utmost caution, and use this contract only after fully appreciating the implications on both a technical and legal level.

By using this contract, the user explicitly acknowledges and agrees to these terms and conditions. Failure to heed these disclaimers and instructions may lead to adversarial consequences for which neither the developers nor any other associated party shall be held responsible.


## System Setup

To set up the XenGame environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Solidity and the required dependencies.
2. Clone the XenGame repository from GitHub.
3. Compile the Solidity contracts using a compatible compiler.
4. Deploy the contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using a development network or one of your choice.
5. Interact with the deployed contracts through their respective addresses.

## Contracts

The XenGame project consists of three contracts:

1. XenGame: The main contract that handles the game logic, key purchases, rewards distribution, and round management.
2. NFTRegistry: A contract that manages the registration of NFTs for use within the XenGame ecosystem.
3. XenBurn: A contract to burn Ether as part of the game's mechanics.

Developers are encouraged to utilize the NFTRegistry and XenBurn contracts for their own open-source projects related to Xen.

## Testing

The XenGame project uses Foundry for testing. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install Foundry and the required dependencies.
2. Run the Foundry test command to execute all the unit tests and ensure the proper functioning of the contracts.

```
foundry test
```

Make sure you have a local Ethereum development network running or specify a different network in the configuration.
